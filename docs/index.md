# Important Updates

## Release 1.0.0

- 4/14/2020: We have uploaded raw fMRI task event files to the NDA for sessions among the 9,647 with task-based fMRI data.  We are working with the NDA to get that data released publicly prior to 5/15/2020.
- 2/17/2020: The NDA confirmed for us last week that the uploaded data is all released.  This brings our subject counts to **10,038 MRI sessions worth of NDA imagingcollection01 data** and **9,647 MRI sessions worth of NDA fmriresults01 data**.
